Deanna is a technical writer with experience working in a docs-as-code environment. Before she became a technical writer, she taught developmental writing at various colleges in the Cleveland area (The University of Akron, Cuyahoga Community College, Lakeland Community College). And before that, she studied linguistics for six years.

Her work as a Technical Writer blends her years of experience as an English teacher, working with learners of all ages, and an interest in programming.

When she's not working, she's probably practicing her watercolors ðŸ–Œ, going for walks ðŸŒ², or checking out the latest on Netflix ðŸ“º!
