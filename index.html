    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm a technical writer with experience working in a docs-as-code environment. Before I became a technical
        writer, I taught developmental writing at various colleges in the Cleveland area. And before that, I studied linguistics for six years.
    </p>

    <p>My work as a Technical Writer blends my years of experience as an English teacher, working with learners of all
        ages, and an interest in programming!</p>
